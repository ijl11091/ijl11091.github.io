	<p Style="text-align:center"> On the first day of September in 1924 Milly Molly woke up like she always did. She walked downstairs to feed her pet alpaca some worms. Her pet Alpaca, Johnny was her best friend in the entire world. Johnny was famous in their town of RonStrally, and was a hit at the local elementary school. Milly Molly and Johnny would take a trip to the elementary school every Wednesday so the kids could feed him some worms. On this particular Monday Morning Milly Molly has plans to train Johnny to jump through a hoola hoop, because she knew the kids would love that. AS Milly Molly pulled out Johnny's favorite food, she looked down and then noticed her hands looked different. When she look down she noticed there were strange spider-like webs on them. Molly jolted to the bathroom only to find the most disturbing picture in the mirror in front of her.  </p>

	 <p> Milly Molly quickly ran to her encyclopedia to look up everything she could on little girls turning into spider man. She opened it to page thirty-two to find a table of all the reasons she could have turned into spider man:

	<p Style="text-align:center ; color=blue"> Milly Molly saw the causes and was horrified. She went to her computer to start doing some extensive research on Alpacas in order to find out what about Johnny could have caused her to turn into spider-man. So Milly Molly opened up her computer and went to alpacainfor.orf( click to see the link below). As she searched through the website, she still couuld not find the answers to her mysterious transformation into spider-man. Milly Molly was growing more and more frustrated every second, and she could tell Johnny was also getting upset. So Milly Molly decided there was only one thing she could do... embrace herself as spiderman. </P>

	<p Style="text-align:center ; color=blue"> Milly Molly sprung her hand out and a line of spiderwebs sprung out, wrapped around Johnny. They flew out of the house and started going back and forth throughout all of the buildings like the original spiderman. Johnny had a smile on his face like never before. Both johnny and Milly Molly were swaying through the air having the time of their lives as the wind flew through their hair. While enjoying themselves, they saw a big lit up-building with bold lights flashing. "A movie a movie!!!" said Johnny. Milly Molly looked around and thought for a minute. Finally she decided if she had already turned into spiderman, why not see a movie. They landed to the ground to view the showing times and the following showtimes appeared. </P>
